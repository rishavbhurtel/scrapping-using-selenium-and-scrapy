"Fantastic customer experience! We purchased a new 350L Jewell Tank from Lincs after visiting the store. All of the staff were friendly and helpful and we thought we would rather buy from a local store with good service than roll the dice and order from eBay etc for the sake of a Â£20 saving. We are so glad we did. Through no fault of Lincs, Jewell had uncharacteristically made some errors with the cabinet and the box contained the wrong parts. We called Lincs and they arranged for a cabinet to be opened up in the showroom and drove the missing parts over on the same day!

"Fantastic customer experience! We purchased a new 350L Jewell Tank from Lincs after visiting the store. All of the staff were friendly and helpful and we thought we would rather buy from a local store with good service than roll the dice and order from eBay etc for the sake of a Â£20 saving. We are so glad we did. Through no fault of Lincs, Jewell had uncharacteristically made some errors with the cabinet and the box contained the wrong parts. We called Lincs and they arranged for a cabinet to be opened up in the showroom and drove the missing parts over on the same day!

Living on a main road. I needed to have something that would give me security of my two puppies running around the yard.. can not stress how wonderful it is know that they stay safe in their boundaries.. They love the freedom of running over the yard. Mostly barking at cars or bicycle riders(sorry). And we enjoy the easiness of them going out getting their business done and come back in.

"Fantastic customer experience! We purchased a new 350L Jewell Tank from Lincs after visiting the store. All of the staff were friendly and helpful and we thought we would rather buy from a local store with good service than roll the dice and order from eBay etc for the sake of a Â£20 saving. We are so glad we did. Through no fault of Lincs, Jewell had uncharacteristically made some errors with the cabinet and the box contained the wrong parts. We called Lincs and they arranged for a cabinet to be opened up in the showroom and drove the missing parts over on the same day! Special thanks to Ben in the warehouse who could answer my pre-sales questions on the tanks like an expert and arranged for delivery on the day that suited us over the phone. We will definitely buy from Lincs in the future and won't hesitate to recommend them.",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.lincsaquatics.co.uk,Lincs Aquatics,http://www.lincsaquatics.co.uk?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/5a76410a4c19820001123e07/198x149.png

Living on a main road. I needed to have something that would give me security of my two puppies running around the yard.. can not stress how wonderful it is know that they stay safe in their boundaries..

"I love the bridles, I purchased both a snaffle and double for my boy as well as the comfort girth.  My barn owner purchased a girth after seeing mine and my trainer has purchased a double bridle for her Grand Prix horse after trying mine.",4,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/totacomfortsystem.com,Tota Comfort System,http://totacomfortsystem.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshotlogo-domain/57e18b380000ff000594f7ff/198x149.png
I have emailed several times with no success in getting a return email.  All of the emails were about ordering so I am confused about why I don't ever hear from anyone.  What I did order online did arrive in a week or so but my questions were never answered.  The product is great but the customer service needs some work.,5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/totacomfortsystem.com,Tota Comfort System,http://totacomfortsystem.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshotlogo-domain/57e18b380000ff000594f7ff/198x149.png
I cannot get over the quality of this bridle!  I also can't get over the stellar customer service.  I will definitely recommend the TCS to my friends!,3,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/totacomfortsystem.com,Tota Comfort System,http://totacomfortsystem.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshotlogo-domain/57e18b380000ff000594f7ff/198x149.png
This noseband has helped alleviate the discomfort that a traditional noseband can cause when snug. My horse  seems much more comfortable and less fidgety with the bits. We love it!,5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/totacomfortsystem.com,Tota Comfort System,http://totacomfortsystem.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshotlogo-domain/57e18b380000ff000594f7ff/198x149.png

"My two daughters and I have had the Kan Teq body protectors for the last 5 years. Mine has been worn most days, and it is still going strong. I struggled with other body protectors making my arms go numb, but when I have the Kan Teq on, I literally forget I have it on. As my daughter grew I just had to get a new cover, so it ends up very cost effective too. Great company to deal with.",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.kanteq.com,Kan Teq,http://www.kanteq.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/5ba2703e23ad98000159acc6/198x149.png
I have had my Kan vest for a couple of years now and I love it!  I canâ€™t feel it when it is on. It feels like it molds to my body and disappears.  It does not get in my way at all. I live in Hawaii which is hot and humid and wearing the vest is not a problem.  I have osteoporosis and know riding is a risk but I love to ride so wearing this vest which provides solid protection gives me great peace of mind.,5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.kanteq.com,Kan Teq,http://www.kanteq.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/5ba2703e23ad98000159acc6/198x149.png
Knowledgeable staff informed me of the brand and the technology and fitted my body protector. I wouldn't have any other now! Most comfortable body protector I've ever had and love that the shoulder guards are incorporated into the design.,5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.kanteq.com,Kan Teq,http://www.kanteq.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/5ba2703e23ad98000159acc6/198x149.png
Great products and customer service has been great to work with during this pandemic too. Highly suggest,5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/backontrackproducts.com,Back on Track,http://backontrackproducts.com/?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/53345645000064000578777c/0x0.png
"Fantastic body protector, wouldnâ€™t wear anything else. Makes me feel safe and secure and I forget Iâ€™m wearing it, very comfortable. Love it.",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.kanteq.com,Kan Teq,http://www.kanteq.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/5ba2703e23ad98000159acc6/198x149.png
"I love my Kan, I wouldn't ride without it! When I do come off, which thankfully isn't too often, I can feel the impact dissipate through the vest and I don't feel the ""crunch"" in my ribs that would have taken me a while to recover from.  It gives me the confidence to get back on there! I highly recommend my Kan Tec.",5,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.kanteq.com,Kan Teq,http://www.kanteq.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/5ba2703e23ad98000159acc6/198x149.png
